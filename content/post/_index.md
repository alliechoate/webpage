Below are links to R code scripts that I have created for either my own personal research or for statistics courses at my university. I have also uploaded all of my teaching slides/assignments from our into to regression and ANOVA graduate course I have previously taught. There's also a section for helpful (and FREE) resources for learning R & running various models in R that I have compiled (and am always updating frequently)!
