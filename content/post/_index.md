Below are links to R code scripts that I have created for either my own personal research or for statistics courses at my university. You will also find a section for helpful (and FREE) resources for learning R & other statistical models that I have compiled (and am usually updating frequently)!

In addition, I am in the process of uploading powerpoints and homework assignments that I previously created for my students in our grad level intro to regression/ANOVA course. Feel free to e-mail me if you would like an answer key for any of the homework assignments posted!
