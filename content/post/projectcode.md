  * Mauscript is under review and used multivariate latent growth curve models with structured residuals
  to examines daily change in several emotion regulation strategies during treatment in a partial
  hospitalization program.

Citation: Choate, A. M., Gorey, C., Rappaport, L. M., Wiernik, B. M., & Bornovalova, M. A. (2021). Alternative model of personality disorders traits predict residential addictions treatment completion. Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 228, 109011.

  * MIMIC models were used to examine the invariance of PID-5 personality traits with respect to age and gender.
  * Survival analyses were then used to examine treatment dropout based on interactions with PID-5 scores and age/gender. Code for the MIMIC models and survival models are provided on OSF.

Will be adding other code scripts here in the near future.
