Hi! My name is Allie, and I am a third year student in the Clinical Psychology PhD program at the University of South Florida. I work under the mentorship of Dr. Marina Bornovalova, and am broadly interested in researching personality pathology and other externalizing behaviors. Feel free to check out our lab website here: [Dexter Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/dexterresearchlab/home), or view my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YQmDPkmclBLfb7_futzazynfCyC9mMJz/view?usp=sharing)!

I'm also, as you probably have guessed, very interested in statistics and applying new quantitative methodologies to psychological phenomena. I am an avid R user, and am excited to be teaching the lab section for our graduate level 'Regression/ANOVA' course this fall (which will be taught in R!) I made this website primarily to add new materials that I've created for the Regression course, but have also added code from other course curriculum I've assisted with, and just general code from projects and other classes as well. My hope is that maybe some of these materials may or may not be helpful for other researchers in psychology! Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions about any of the materials!

#### Also, for your personal enjoyment, here's a picture of my cat and his R-code.
