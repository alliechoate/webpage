Hello! My name is Allie, and I am a third year clinical psychology PhD student at the University of South Florida. I completed my BA in psychology at the University of Missouri, and now work under the mentorship of Dr. Marina Bornovalova at USF in Tampa. Broadly speaking, I am interested in personality pathology and other externalizing beahviors, as well as the application of quantitative methodologies to better understand psychological phenomena. You can find out more about my research interests [here](https://alliechoate.netlify.com/portfolio/), or view my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YQmDPkmclBLfb7_futzazynfCyC9mMJz/view?usp=sharing).


**Statistics & Coding Experience:**

  - I have experience working in JASP, JMP, Matlab, MPlus, SAS, & SPSS, but consider myself to be an avid R user. I have experience teaching R at the graduate level for our intro to Regression/Anova course, and have posted my teaching materials [here](https://alliechoate.netlify.com/post/reganova/). 
  
I made this website primarily to host code/ materials I've made with the hopes that some of these resources may be helpful for other researchers or students! _Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions about my code/materials!_
