Hi! My name is Allie, and I am a third year student in the Clinical Psychology PhD program at the University of South Florida. I work under the mentorship of Dr. Marina Bornovalova, and am broadly interested in researching personality pathology and other externalizing behaviors. Feel free to check out our lab website here: [Dexter Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/dexterresearchlab/home), or view my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YQmDPkmclBLfb7_futzazynfCyC9mMJz/view?usp=sharing)!

I am also interested in statistics and applying new quantitative methodologies to better understand psychological phenomena. I am an avid R user and have experience teaching R at the graduate level as well. I made this website primarily to host code/teaching materials I've made with the hope that some of these resources may or may not be helpful for other researchers and students in psychology! Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions about any of the materials!

#### Also, for your personal enjoyment, here's a picture of my cat and his R-code.
