Hi! My name is Allie and I am an incoming third year student in the Clinical Psychology PhD program at the University of South Florida. I work under the mentorship of Dr. Marina Bornovalova, and I am broadly interested in researching personality pathology and other externalizing behaviors. Feel free to check out our lab website here: [Dexter Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/dexterresearchlab/home)

<br>

I made this website primarily to add new materials I make or come across to not only keep myself organized, but to also provide free materials that may or may not be helpful for other researchers! Enjoy!

#### Also, for your personal enjoyment, here's a picture of my cat and his R-code.
