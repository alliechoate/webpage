Hello! My name is Allie, and I am a fifth year clinical psychology PhD student at the University of South Florida. I completed my BA in psychology at the University of Missouri, and now work under the mentorship of Dr. Marina Bornovalova at USF in Tampa, FL. 

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the development and maintenance of personality pathology, substance use, and other forms of psychopathology. My secondary research interests include how to better apply quantitative methodologies to improve the understanding of psychological phenomena, 
in addition to health economics research related to behavioral/pharmalogical interventions. You can find out more about my research interests [here](https://alliechoate.netlify.app/portfolio/), or view my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ozeP0N0JMMzJpPgZpo8-F-zTyFWw_j1A/view?usp=sharing).


**Statistics and Coding Experience:**

  - I have experience working in JASP, JMP, Matlab, MPlus, SAS, and SPSS, but mostly work in R/R-Studio. I have experience teaching R at the graduate level for our intro to Regression/Anova course, and have posted my teaching materials [here](https://alliechoate.netlify.app/post/reganova/). 


I made this website primarily to host code and materials I've made with the hopes that some of these resources may be helpful for other researchers or students! _Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions about my code or materials!_
