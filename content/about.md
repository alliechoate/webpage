Hi! My name is Allie, and I am a third year student in the Clinical Psychology PhD program at the University of South Florida. I work under the mentorship of Dr. Marina Bornovalova, and am broadly interested in personality pathology and other externalizing behaviors. You can find out more about my research interests [here](https://alliechoate.netlify.com/portfolio/), or view my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YQmDPkmclBLfb7_futzazynfCyC9mMJz/view?usp=sharing)!

I am also interested in applying new quantitative methodologies to better understand psychological phenomena. I am an avid R user, and have experience teaching R at the graduate level as well for our intro to Regression/Anova course. I made this website primarily to host code/teaching materials I've made with the hopes that some of these resources may be helpful for other researchers or students! Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions about any of the materials!

#### Also, for your personal enjoyment, here's a picture of my cat and his R-code.
