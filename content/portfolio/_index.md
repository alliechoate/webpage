### Research Interests:

Most of my research focuses on the intersection of personality pathology (particularly borderline personality disorder) and its role in substance use, criminal behavior, and other co-occurring psychopathology. Additionally, a large portion of my work focuses on developmental theories behind co-occurring psychopathology and the 'p-factor.'
