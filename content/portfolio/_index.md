### Research Interests:

Most of my research focuses on the intersection of personality pathology, particularly borderline personality disorder (BPD), and its role in substance use, criminal behavior, and fostering other forms of co-occurring psychopathology. 

I am also interested in the application of different quanatative methodologies to better understand the developmental trajectories of co-occurring psychopathology throughout adolescence into adulthood.
