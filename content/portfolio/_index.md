### Research Interests:

Most of my research focuses on the intersection of personality pathology (particularly borderline personality disorder) and its role in substance use, criminal behavior, and other co-occurring psychopathology. Additionally, a large portion of my work focuses on developmental theories behind co-occurring psychopathology and the 'p-factor.'

**A brief description of some of my current research projects can be found below:**

#### Current Research Projects:
<br>

  - Gender differences in the assessment of psychopathy and borderline personality disorder (BPD) traits
  
  - Dynamic mutualism theory as a plausible explanation for the development of the general p-factor
  
  - Relationship between personality, psychopathology, and current substance use in predicting criminal recidivism
  
  - Associations between hopelessness, psychological pain, and social connectedness (3ST theory) in predicting suicidal ideation in substance using populations 
  
  - Personality differences between law enforcement job candidates who are recommended for employment compared to those who are not recommended
  
  - Use of data simulation for improving psychological theories (with a particular interest in using simulations to better understand underlying developmental mechanisms in BPD)
  
  - Examining change in the use of emotion regulation strategies during treatment and its relationship with post-treatment outcomes (e.g., quality of life, symptom change in depression, anxiety, etc.)
